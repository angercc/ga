After u make a heroku account you have to check every folder and change the heroku app to point that way so for example so lets say the heroku app name you made is yun-pro you would have to change every part of the script that sais aim-ware to yun-pro .

After that you have to go to Deploy tab and follow the steps in the discord server on how to deploy if you have any questions dm me

The only steps you rlly have to follow are up to the part where it says

$ git add .
$ git commit -am "make it better"
$ git push heroku master

After u do that for the first time you can just run update.bat after u update the script to update the server
